known:

- $\Delta=0$
- $\sigma_A^2=\sigma_B^2=1$
- $n=m$


## 1.1 

n=17

```{r, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Power calculations for two sample t tests
power.t.test(delta = 1,sd = 1,power = 0.8,type='two.sample')
```


##1.2

where $\Delta$ increase, the n will reduce.


```{r}
power.t.test(delta = 2,sd = 1,power = 0.8,type='two.sample')
power.t.test(delta = 3,sd = 1,power = 0.8,type='two.sample')
power.t.test(delta = 5,sd = 1,power = 0.8,type='two.sample')
```

##1.3

where $\sigma$ increase, the n will increase.

```{r}
power.t.test(delta = 1,sd = 2,power = 0.8,type='two.sample')
power.t.test(delta = 1,sd = 3,power = 0.8,type='two.sample')
power.t.test(delta = 1,sd = 5,power = 0.8,type='two.sample')
```


#hw2

Chi-squared Test


$H_0 :$ this is fair dice.

$H_1 :$ this is unfair dice.


the p value of Chi-squared Test is less than 0 ,so we shoud reject $H_0$ ,which means that this is unfair dice.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Chi-squared Test
p0 <- (5/6)^3
p1 <- 3 * 1/6 * 5/6 * 5/6
p2 <- 3 * 1/6 * 1/6 * 5/6
p3 <- (1/6)^3
p <- c(p0,p1,p2,p3)
games <- c(48,35,15,3)
chisq.test(x = games,p = p)
```

In this competition, Zillow is asking you to predict the log-error between their Zestimate and the actual sale price, given all the features of a home. The log error is defined as $$logerror=log(Zestimate)-log(SalePrice)$$ and it is recorded in the transactions file train.csv. In this competition, you are going to predict the logerror for the months in Fall 2017. Since all the real estate transactions in the U.S. are publicly available, we will close the competition (no longer accepting submissions) before the evaluation period begins.

**Finally, I find that the $logerror$ in dataset of Zillow competition is not a normal distribution and there are some outlier points which can be observed in histogram and boxplot.**


```{r}
x <- read.csv('Downloads/train_2016_v2.csv',stringsAsFactors = F)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(x$logerror,main='Histogram with outline',breaks = 100)
hist(x$logerror,xlim = c(-1,1),breaks = 100,main='Histogram without outline',xlab='logerror')

boxplot(x$logerror,outline = T,main='Boxplot with outline')
boxplot(x$logerror,outline = F,main='Boxplot without outline')

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
car::qqPlot(x$logerror,main='Q-Q plot')
```
